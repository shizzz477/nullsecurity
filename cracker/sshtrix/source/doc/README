NOTES:

* I hereby emphasize that sshtrix is for education purposes only. I do not take
  any responsibility for any abuse or misuse!

* For install instructions, read the INSTALL file. For usage instruction, refer
  to the '-H' option or read the manual page (man sshtrix). Remember, you need
  libssh version >= 0.5.0 - get the sources from http://www.libssh.org/ if your
  lame distribution lacks of new software.

* Before asking me for features, you should take a quick look into doc/TODO
  list, please. :)

cheers,
noptrix
